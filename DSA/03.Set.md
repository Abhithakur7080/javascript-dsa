# Set

- A set is a data structure that can hold a collection of values. The values however must be unique.
- Set can contain a mix of different data types. You can store strings, booleans, numbers or even objects all in the same set.
- Sets are dynamically sized. You don't have to declare the size of a set before creating it.
- Sets do not maintain an insertion order.
- Sets are iterables. They can be used with a for of loop.

#### Set vs Array
- Arrays can contain duplicate values whereas Sets cannot.
- Insertion order is maintained in arrays but it is not the case with sets.
- Searching and deleting an element in the set is faster compared to arrays.

#### some code example
```javascript
const set = new Set([1,2,3])
//[1,2,3]

//add new item
set.add(4)//[1,2,3,4]
set.add(4)//[1,2,3,4](duplicate not allowed)

//check if set has or not
console.log(set.has(4));//true

//delete item
set.delete(3)//[1,2,4]

//check set size
console.log(set.size);//3

//delete all set item or empty set
set.clear()

for(const item of set){
    console.log(item);
}
```

#### Time Complexity
- Insert/add - O(1)
- Remove/delete - O(1)
- check/has - O(1)
- size - O(1)
- Remove/clear all - O(1)
