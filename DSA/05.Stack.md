# Stack
- The `stack data structure` is a sequential collection of elements that follows the principle of `Last In First Out` (LIFO).
- The `last element inserted` into the stack is `first element to be removed`.
- A stack of plates. The last placed on top of the stack is also the first plate removed from the stack.
- Stack is an abstract data type. It is defined by its behavior rather than being a mathematical model.

- The stack data structure supports two main operations
    - Push, which adds an element to the collection.
    - Pop, which removes the most recently added element from the collection.
