#  Map
- A map is an ordered collection of key-value pairs. Both keys and values can be of any data type.
- To retrive a value, you can use the corresponding key.
- Maps are iterables. They can be used with a for of loop.

#### Object vs map
- Objects are unordered whereas maps are ordered.
- Keys in objects can only be string type whereas in maps, they can be of any type.
- An object has a prototype and may contain few default keys which may collide with your own keys if you're not careful. A map on the other hand does not contain any keys by default.
- Objects are not iterables whereas maps are itereables
- The number of items in an object must be determined manually whereas it is readily available with the size property in a map.
- Apart from storing data, you can attach functionality to an object whereas maps are restricted to just storing data.

#### some code example
```javascript
const map = new Map([['a', 1], ['b', 2]]);
/*
a: 1
b: 2
*/
//add new item
map.set('c', 3)
/*
a: 1
b: 2
c: 3
*/
//check if key in map has or not
console.log(map.has('a'));//true

//delete an item
map.delete('c')
/*
a: 1
b: 2
*/

console.log(map.size);//2

//delete all keys from map
map.clear()

for(const [key, value] of map){
    console.log(`${key}: ${value}`);
}
```

#### Time Complexity
- Insert/add - O(1)
- Remove/delete - O(1)
- check/has - O(1)
- size - O(1)
- Remove/clear all - O(1)
