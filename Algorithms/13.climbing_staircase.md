# Climbing Staircase

<ins>**Problem**</ins>: Given a staircase of `n` steps, count the number of distinct ways to climb to the top. You can either climb 1 step or 2 steps at a time.

```
n=1

climbingStaircase(1) = 1 -> (1)
```
```
n=2

climbingStaircase(2) = 2 -> (1,1) and (2)
```
```
n=3

climbingStaircase(3) = 3 -> (1,1,1), (1,2) and (2,1)
```
```
n=4

climbingStaircase(4) = 5 -> (1,1,1,1) and (1,1,2), (1,2,1),(2,1,1) and (2,2)
```

#### Pseudocode/Idea
- At any given time, you can climb either `1 step` or `2 steps`.
- If you have to climb to step `n`, we can only from step `n-1` or `n-2`.
- Calculate the ways we can climb to `n-1` and `n-2` steps and add the two.<br>
`climbingStaircase(n) = climbingStaircase(n-1) + climbingStaircase(n-2)`

#### Code Solution
```javascript
function climbingStaircase(n){
    const noOfWays = [1, 2];
    for(let i=2; i<=n; i++){
        noOfWays[i] = noOfWays[i-1] + noOfWays[i-2];
    }
    return noOfWays[n-1];
}

console.log(climbingStaircase(1));//1
console.log(climbingStaircase(2));//2
console.log(climbingStaircase(3));//3
console.log(climbingStaircase(4));//5
console.log(climbingStaircase(5));//8
```

#### Time Complexity 
Here running 1 loops for n times so complexity here O(n)

```
    for(let i=0; i<arr1.length; i++){
        for(j=0; j<arr2.length; j++){
            result.push([arr1[i], arr2[j]]);
        }
    }
```

`Time complexity` - O(n)
